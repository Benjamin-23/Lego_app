# DOMA Protocol Dashboard

This project is a modern web dashboard built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), designed to interact with and visualize data from the **DOMA Protocol**. The application provides a seamless user experience for managing domains, monitoring alerts, and tracking activity, all while leveraging the power and security of the DOMA Protocol.

## About the DOMA Protocol

**DOMA Protocol** is a decentralized protocol for domain management and ownership. It enables users to register, transfer, and manage domain names on-chain, ensuring transparency, security, and censorship resistance. By integrating DOMA, this dashboard allows users to interact directly with the protocol, view their domain assets, receive real-time alerts, and monitor protocol activity.

### How This Project Uses DOMA Protocol

- **Domain Management:** Users can view and manage their registered domains through the dashboard, with all data fetched directly from the DOMA Protocol smart contracts.
- **Alerts:** The app provides real-time alerts for important events such as domain expirations, transfers, or protocol updates, leveraging DOMA‚Äôs event system.
- **Activity Feed:** All protocol-related activities (registrations, renewals, transfers) are displayed in an activity log, sourced from DOMA‚Äôs on-chain events.
- **Wallet Integration:** Users connect their wallets to authenticate and interact with the DOMA Protocol, ensuring secure and permissionless access.
